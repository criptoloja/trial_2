## Trial:
For the trial, we would like you to create a responsive, mobile-first web application using Laravel, Livewire, Bootstrap, and any other Laravel package or third-party library that you may find useful. The application should include the following features:

1.  **Account Management**: Develop a feature that allows users to create and manage their own accounts, complete with a profile page and basic authentication functionality. Users should be able to sign up, log in, update their profile information, and view their account details.
2.  **Search and Filter**: Create a feature that allows users to search for and filter data based on various criteria, such as date, location, or category. The search functionality should be implemented using Livewire, and should update the search results in real-time as the user types in their query.
3.  **Dashboard**: Build a custom dashboard that displays data in real-time, including charts, graphs, and tables. Users should be able to filter and sort data as needed, and the data should be updated in real-time using Livewire.
4.  **Migrations and Seeding**: Use migrations and seeders to generate mock data.

We encourage you to add your own touch to the design and functionality of the web application, while ensuring that it meets the requirements outlined above. Once completed, please provide us with the source code and instructions on how to run the application.
